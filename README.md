# The Sweepstakes!

Dear friends, family & footballers, welcome to the Sweepstake repository! This README explains how the sweepstake works, presents the draw and vaguely describes prizes to be won.

- [Current! Euro Germany 2024](euro24/README.md)
- [World Cup Qatar 2022](worldcup22/README.md) - Winner: Jackie with Italy!

## How it Works

The Sweepstake is free to enter. Teams in the competition are sorted by their FIFA World Ranking and divided into two categories: *upper* and *lower*. Each player is randomly assigned two teams -- one from the *upper* category and one from the *lower* category.

### Prizes

Prizes will be awarded to players with:
- The *winning* team, and,
- The *best performing* team from the *lower* category.

Note that *best performing* will be decided in the following order: tournament progression, head-to-head match-ups, goal difference and goals scored. 

Prizes will be highly personalized to the winner(s).

### The Draw

The random seed is always the start date of the tournament in DDMMYYYY format.
