# World Cup 2022 - Qatar

## Introduction

Welcome, dear friends, family & footballers to the internationally renowned World Cup Sweepstake. This README explains how the sweepstake works, presents the draw and gives vaguely describes prizes to be won.

For the geeks among you, the code is available. Data munging code is [here](https://github.com/benjiebob/WorldCup22_Sweepstake/blob/main/extract_rankings.py) and a simple-to-run Jupyter Notebook which actually computes the draw is [here](https://github.com/benjiebob/WorldCup22_Sweepstake/blob/main/run_worldcup_draw.ipynb).

Good luck!

## How it Works

The Wweepstake is free to enter. The 32 World Cup teams are sorted according to their FIFA World Ranking and divided into two categories: upper and lower. Each player is randomly assigned one team from the Upper category and one from the lower category.

## Prizes

Prizes will be awarded to:
- The player with the *winning* World Cup team, and
- The player with the *best performing* team ranked in the bottom 8 according to FIFA World Cup Ranking. The teams eligible for this prize are: *Costa Rica, Australia, Canada, Cameroon, Ecuador, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Ghana*.

The precise nature of the prizes will be revealed towards the end of the tournament. However, the esteemed organizing committee (of which there are at least two doctors) anticipate that the prizes will have a strong degree of personalization.

## The Draw

A random seed was selected based on the start date of the World Cup: **20112022**. The results of the [draw](https://github.com/benjiebob/WorldCup22_Sweepstake/blob/main/run_worldcup_draw.ipynb) are as follows:
